## Introduction

Description:
This is a project of a simple real-time news website. It was developed while I was studying APIs and how to integrate them into web projects.

Functionality:
The website uses the GNews API to fetch the latest news from various reliable sources. The API provides access to a wide range of real-time news, covering different topics

Although it is a simple project, it was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as learn about API integration.
